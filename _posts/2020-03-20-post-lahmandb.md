Ok, maybe it's not.... yet.

I'm very much into baseball due to the long season and the opportunity to capture a great amount of data over the 162 regular season games played throughout the year. This season will be a little different.

With the outbreak of COVID-19, the start of baseball season is pushed back and the actual season is in question. Sad day...

What can a baseball fan do while the season is out??? Hone your sabermetric skills, that's what!

Sabermetrics is an analysis technique of baseball that measures in-game play and activities. Since we're going to have some time away from the diamond, let's learn how to properly map your favorite players performance when he get's back!

First, we'll need a place to start. You can follow my [Kanban approach to my learning style here.](https://github.com/jeff-mos-def/jeff-mos-def.github.io/projects/1)

As with every data mining opportunity, we'll need a large amount of data to pull from. We're going to be using the [Lahman database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) for our baseball stats.

Lahman's database is a great resource that provides a comprehensive list of baseball stats from 1871-2019.

From the `master.csv` file, we can see that Nolan Ryan was born on 31 Jan 1947 in Refugio, Tx. At his playing weight, he weighed 170 lbs, batted right, and threw right. He debuted on 11 Sep 1966 and played his final game on 22 Sep 1993.

In the `batting.csv` file, you can see that Nolan Arenado played in 156 games in 2018, getting 175 hits, 38 doubles, 2 triples, adn 38 homeruns.

The pitching, fielding, and teams files also have data representative of the data format given.

Stay tuned for more baseball insights!
