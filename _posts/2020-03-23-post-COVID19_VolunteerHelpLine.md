![Tough times](/assets/images/toughtimes.jpg "Social distance")

Time's are going to be tough. There's no workaround on that.

As I sit in my office chair drinking from a mug that is supposed to inspire me, I feel slightly downtrodden. Customers have been lost, I've had to restucture my business in order to address the ongoing crisis, and then I've had to create another business to generate revenue for the clients I've lost.

But this won't get me down. Not today.

Today I've decided to spent the good amount of time that I now have to creating a help/support system for those that will definately need it.

I've started working on a support hotline staffed by volunteers to respond to people in need whether that would be food, supplies, or other types of aid.

Check the status of the [project here](https://github.com/jeff-mos-def/jeff-mos-def.github.io/projects/2).

The process flow of the call line is somewhat simple. It will be a call/SMS system based in Twilio, which is a cloud communications platform as a service company based in San Francisco, California. People in need would be able to respond to the toll free call line via text or call and the message would be passed down the line to a system of volunteers. The process for this line can be [seen here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/jeff-mos-def.github.io/master/assets/images/Flow%20Chart_Call%20Line.jpeg).

In order to provide an outreach platform for this number, a simple face-of-the-service website will be created. This site will act as a local internet platform for reachout and volunteer signup.

I refuse to let this keep me from making a local impact.

One of my favorite sports movies ever is _Any Given Sunday_.

In one of the final scenes of the movie, Coach Tony D'Amato gives a speech that should ring true to anyone managing a team that is facing a bleak future.

We will heal. We will persevere. 

As I'm finishing this entry, it is speculated that Travis County, Tx will be issuing a stay-at-home order. I will keep you updated on my progress of this pursuit.
