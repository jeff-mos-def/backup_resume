### So it looks like we've got a little bit of stay-at-home time on our hands... maybe.

If you're in the group of people that COVID-19 has locked up in your home, no worries. I have got something that will take your mind off things for about 4 and a half hours.

Due to the current situation we're in, [Ahref's](https://ahrefs.com/) is providing **free blogging for business** training by the talented Tim Soulo. If you're not familiar with Ahrefs, this is a top tier SAAS company that provides fantastic tools for your business, non-profit, or just research. 

You can access tools such as:
* Site Explorer
* Site Audit
* Keywords Explorer
* Rank Tracker
* Content Explorer
* SEO toolbar

The quick breakdown does not do this site justice. You can easily generate marketing and competing company reports to narrow in on your campaigns and competition. I won't dive too deep into that here, but I just wanted to leave a small note about it.

The Blogging for Business training is training usually priced at $799, but is being offered for free right now. You can find the link in the picture below.

If you're interested in learning how to write for your site a little better, or if you're just starting out, give it a look while you've got some time.
