# README for my little website

If you like this site, fork this repo for the quickest method of getting started with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

This site contains my projects and thoughts and serves as an outlet for staying current in programming.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions on the site!
