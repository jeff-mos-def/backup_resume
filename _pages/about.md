Hello! 

This is my **working** website, which I will use to update the current projects I'm working on, as well as many other things that may be tossing around in my head.

First and foremost, if you're here looking for my professional resume, here you go:

Now! About who I am!

I am a United States Army veteran that served 7.5 years from Jan 2000 to Jul 2007. I served my time as a Special Electronics Device Repairer, now 94F, as separated as a Sergeant.

I left the military to enroll at Texas State University, in which I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering, with a focus on Micro-Nano Device Fabrication, and a Minor in Mathematics. It takes a deep breath to say all of that!

I've been working as a small business owner since 2018 and am using the marketing and analytical skills gained from that opportunity to transition into data science. This page will outline much of the work I've been doing.

I live in Central Texas with my significant other and we own two super awesome Corgis.

I'm a huge fitness nut and a crossfitter since 2016. I want to compile my fitness data sometime soon and display this here!

I'm also interested in using my knowledge and skills to:

* Offer marketing guidance to small business owners
* Work with non-profits
* Create educational material
* Express myself through postings, such as this

I look forward to adding much more to this page!
